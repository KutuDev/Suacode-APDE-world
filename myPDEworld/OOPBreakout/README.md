## Inspiration

Creative coding has been a tested and trusted way to learn to code as a beginner. Specifically, creating a game app for smartphones is a fantastic starting point for practising software development. Hence, I created a fairly complex game called *Breakout* using a Java-based programming language by the name *Processing*. This game is the required SuaCode Africa 1.0 smartphone-based coding course final project.

## Overview

Breakout is a single player game that consists of three game elements; paddle, ball, bricks. The player moves the paddle horizontally in order to have it collide with a randomly moving ball. The rebounce obtained from this collision is expected to have a brick disappear when hit by the ball. The player score is dependent on the number of bricks cleared. The player lifes is decreased if the battle misses having a collision with the ball.

## Methodology

The game was developed using an Object Oriented Programming(OOP) paradigm. All game elements are encapsulated in a class individually. The game engine's state was also abstracted into objects. The game screen starts as a static scene. The state is changed when a screentouch is detected.

## Challenges
Coding on a smartphone is fun and interesting, yet, there are a number of challenges I encountered. Firstly, writing code to make the various states of the game engine work independently when appropriate was difficult. A screentouch on the screen actiavtes the game engine and also the movement of the paddle is controlled by touch(drag). Furthermore, writing code that appears visually the same way across several mobile device's screen size is a yet to be resolved challenge.

## Accomplishments
I was successfully able to create a beginner level Breakout game app that can be installed on several smartphones.

## Next plan
I hope to add more higher levels of difficulty to the game sometime and also include a database to store high scores.
